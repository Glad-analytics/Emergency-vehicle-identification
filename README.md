# Emergency-vehicle-identification using CNN
Convolutional Neural Network model for classifying emergency vs non-emergency vehicles using image data from Kaggle. Includes full analysis and scientific report.
**Role**: ML Engineer

## üìù Description

This project focuses on the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify emergency and non-emergency vehicles using image data. The model aims to support smart traffic systems by enabling the automatic detection of emergency vehicles (e.g., ambulances, fire trucks, police cars) for prioritized road clearance and response.

The dataset used for training and testing was sourced from Kaggle: [Emergency Vehicle Identification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhisheksinghblr/emergency-vehicles-identification?resource=download).
